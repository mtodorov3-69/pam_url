/etc/pam.d/sshd or /etc/pam.d/system-auth:

[...]
auth sufficient pam_url.so [debug] [config=/etc/pam_url.conf]
[...]

This line forms the following url encoded POST data:
user=<username>&passwd=<pass>&mode=<PAM_AUTH|PAM_ACCT|PAM_SESS|PAM_PASS>&PSK=secret&do=auth
It should return either 200 OK with PSK in the body or 403 Forbidden if unsuccessful.

You can additionally set the following options:

    use_first_pass      Use the password previously used in the pam stack
    prepend_first_pass  Prepend the password previously used in the pam stack
                        (This is a handy option in totpcgi deployments when you want
                        to be able to pass both the password and the token code to the
                        verification server. It's probably not useful for any other
                        purpose.)
    skip_password	Do not prompt for password
			(If one is authenticating a VPN connection with a certificate
			and you need additional permission check like libreswan's
			pam-authorize, then there is no way to prompt the user
			on the other side of IKE to type in the password.
			This option is also handy with pam_radius_auth, where 
			authentication may be preformed i.e. over a remote RADIUS server.)
			CAUTION: use of pam_url without password is only supported if
				 another modules does main authentication previously!
				 Enabling pam_url as the only and sufficient method of
				 communication will leave your system open to login
				 without passwords!

Please take a look inside the examples directory.
Please read the COPYING, INSTALL and AUTHOR files as well.
